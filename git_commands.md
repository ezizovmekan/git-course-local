Here are some basic Git commands:
1. inside the local directory use `git init` command to make that directory git repo.
2. `git clone <repository>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
3. `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area.
4. `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits the changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.
5. `git push`: Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository.
6. `git pull`: Fetches and merges the latest changes from a remote repository.
7. `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
8. `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a different branch.
9. `git merge <branch>`: Merges changes from a different branch into the current branch.
10. `git status`: Shows the current status of the repository.

Remember to replace `<repository>`, `<file>`, and `<branch>` with the appropriate values.
